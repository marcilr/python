Description
       pip  is  a  Python package installer, recommended for installing
       Python packages which are not available in the Debian archive.
       It can work with version control repositories  (currently  only
       Git,  Mercurial, and Bazaar repositories), logs output extensively,
       and prevents partial installs by downloading all requirements
       before starting installation.

       On Debian, pip is the command to use when installing packages
       for Python 2, while pip3 is the command to use when installing
       packages for Python 3.

Commands
       The command comes before any options.  The following commands
       are recognized:

       help   Show help for commands.

       install
              Install packages.

       uninstall
              Uninstall packages.
