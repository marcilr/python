Python


"Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax.
It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic
data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many
system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing
systems.  New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++
(or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation).
Python is also usable as an extension language for applications
written in other languages that need easy-to-use scripting or
automation interfaces."
